# Shiva Framework

[Shiva] - Shiva is a JavaScript library that extends Leadfootjs (https://github.com/theintern/leadfoot), adding additional explicit waits and custom assertions.
Chai (http://chaijs.com/) is the assertion library these custom assertions are based on.


### Installation
```sh
npm install @retailmenot/shiva
```

### Usage
You can include the waits, assertions and commands:

example:
```javascript
var wait = require('@retailmenot/shiva').wait
```

and then access these functions from within your tests.
